Adaption from from http://github.com/rubenfonseca/twitter-amqp-websocket-example to cyclone/restmq

Now that cyclone has websockets build in, restmq has inherited it and I implemented a websocket consumer.

It makes possible to enable javascript applications to receive straight from a queue. Interchange format still JSON.

To test:

- Install:

Twisted Twitter Stream
http://github.com/fiorix/twisted-twitter-stream

RestMQ:
http://github.com/gleicon/restmq


- Deploy the files under templates to a webserver or run python -m SimpleHTTPServer inside the folder.
- edit producer.py and add your passwd and words to filter.
- run it with python producer.py
- Point your browser to your http server
